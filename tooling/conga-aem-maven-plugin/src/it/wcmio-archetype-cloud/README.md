=====================

This is an AEM project set up with the [wcm.io Maven Archetype for AEM][wcmio-maven-archetype-aem].


### Build and deploy

To build the application run

```
mvn clean install
```

To build and deploy the application to your local AEM instance use these scripts:

* `build-deploy.sh` - Build and deploy to author instance
* `build-deploy-publish.sh` - Build and deploy to publish instance
* `build-deploy-author-and-publish.sh` - Build, and then deploy to author and publish instance (in parallel)

The first deployment may take a while until all updated OSGi bundles are installed.

After deployment you can open the sample content page in your browser:

* Author: http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wcmio-archetype-cloud/en.html
* Publish: http://localhost:4503/content/wcmio-archetype-cloud/en.html

You can deploy individual bundles or content packages to the local AEM instances by using:

* `mvn -Pfast cq:install` - Install and deploy bundle or content package to author instance
* `mvn -Pfast,publish cq:install` - Install and deploy bundle or content package to publish instance

### System requirements

* Java 8
* Apache Maven 3.6.0 or higher
